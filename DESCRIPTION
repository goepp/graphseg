Description: Perform segmentation of graph-based signals. Assume a noisy observation
    of a signal two values correspond to vertices on a graph. Assume the true 
    value of the signal is piece-wise constant (where each \italic{piece} is a
    connected subgraph). The main function, \code{graphseg::agraph}, computes the
    segmentation of the signal. The package also includes a wrapper around the competiting
    method \code{flsa::flsa}.
