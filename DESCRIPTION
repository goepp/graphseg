Description: Perform segmentation of graph-based signals. Assume a noisy observation
    of a signal two values correspond to vertices on a graph. Assume the true 
    value of the signal is piece-wise constant (where each 'piece' is a
    connected subgraph). The main function, agraph(), computes the
    segmentation of the signal. The package also includes a wrapper around the competing
    method flsa() (from package 'flsa').
