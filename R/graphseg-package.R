#' graphseg: A package for piece-wise constant estimation of graph-based signal
#'
#' The main function of this package is \code{agraph}, which performs segmentation
#' of signals on graphs into a piecewise-constant signal.
#' (the function \code{graph_aridge} is deprecated and kept here for backward
#' compatibility).
